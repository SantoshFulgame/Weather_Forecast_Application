## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SantoshFulgame/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   You can get the API key by signing up on OpenWeatherMap.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app in action.

## Usage

Enter a city name in the search bar to get the current weather and 4-day forecast. The app will display weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. The background changes dynamically based on the current weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).

## API Reference

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Below are the main API endpoints used:

- Current Weather API: Retrieves the current weather for a location.
- 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast API: Retrieves the forecast for the next 4 days.

Make sure to sign up on OpenWeatherMap and use your API key in the `.env` file.

## Deployment

You can deploy this app using platforms like:

- Vercel: Continuous deployment directly from GitHub.
- Netlify: Easily deploy your React app with drag-and-drop or continuous integration.
- GitHub Pages: Deploy a React app by pushing the build to a `gh-pages` branch.

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with all the static files needed to deploy.

## Known Issues

- Background image may not scroll correctly on certain mobile devices (fixed with media queries).
- Weather API data updates every 3 hours, which may cause delays in forecast changes.
